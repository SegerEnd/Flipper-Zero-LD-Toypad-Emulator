## Current Issues
I'm currently facing the following issues, maybe you can help :) ?

#### Vehicle saving:
Currenly vehicles are working!!, but I still need to implement CMD_WRITE to be able to upgrade and save vehicles from the game. For that we need to implement a saving and loading system for tokens.

## Code Reference
I have used these similair projects, that helped this project for insight and code snippets for the emulation. [Node LD](https://github.com/AlinaNova21/node-ld) & [LD-ToyPad-Emulator](https://github.com/Berny23/LD-ToyPad-Emulator) repository.
