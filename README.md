## Code Reference
I have found a similar project that might be useful for insight and code snippets for the emulation. [Node LD](https://github.com/AlinaNova21/node-ld) & [LD-ToyPad-Emulator](https://github.com/Berny23/LD-ToyPad-Emulator) repository, which could help us understand specific aspects of the ToyPad emulation process.
