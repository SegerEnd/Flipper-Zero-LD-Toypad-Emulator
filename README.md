# Flipper Zero Lego Dimensions ToyPad Emulator
## Overview
This project aims to create a USB emulation app for the Flipper Zero to emulate the functionality of a Lego Dimensions ToyPad.

## Current Issues
I'm currently facing the following issues:

#### Vehicles:
Currenly vehicles are not working there is, I think a issue in the CMD_MODEL or CMD_READ or with the packet generation that is causing it not to work
#### Issue character removing
When removing a character from the ToyPad, the figure is removed, but the indexes are not reset/shifted correctly. Causing unexpected behavior afterwards.

## Code Reference
I have found a similar project that helped this project for insight and code snippets for the emulation. [Node LD](https://github.com/AlinaNova21/node-ld) & [LD-ToyPad-Emulator](https://github.com/Berny23/LD-ToyPad-Emulator) repository.
