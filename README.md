# Flipper Zero Lego Dimensions ToyPad Emulator
## Overview
This project aims to create a USB emulation app for the Flipper Zero to emulate the functionality of a Lego Dimensions ToyPad.

## Project Status
The project is currently in development, but I'm encountering some issues that I need help with. If you're passionate about reverse engineering, USB emulation, or have experience with the Flipper Zero app programming, your help and expertise would be greatly appreciated and is needed to continue this project.

## Planned Features
Emulate Lego Dimensions ToyPad via USB using Flipper Zero.

USB packet emulation for Lego Dimensions ToyPad interaction.

Interface on the Flipper Zero to select minifigures and add to a slot on the toypad

## Current Issues
I'm currently facing the following challenges:

#### Issue 1 USB Connection:
The Flipper Zero is not being detected as a toypad by the PlayStation maybe I need to send and recieve some start packets?
#### Issue 2 Packet generation logic (checksum):
Implement the necessary packet generation logic to replicate the communication between the ToyPad and the videogame

## Code Reference
I have found a similar project that might be useful for insight and code snippets for the emulation. [Node LD](https://github.com/AlinaNova21/node-ld) & [LD-ToyPad-Emulator](https://github.com/Berny23/LD-ToyPad-Emulator) repository, which could help us understand specific aspects of the ToyPad emulation process.
